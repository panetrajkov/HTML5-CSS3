                    Coffee's journey continued with its introduction to Europe in the 16th century. European coffee
                    houses began to emerge, serving as important social hubs where intellectuals and artists would
                    congregate for conversations and creative inspiration. Coffee quickly became a symbol of refinement
                    and sophistication, with its consumption spreading to other parts of the world through global trade.
