            <h3>Different Types of Coffee</h3>
            <p>
                Coffee is a versatile drink, and there are countless ways to enjoy it! From espresso-based drinks to
                brewed coffee, each type has its unique flavor and preparation method. Let's dive into the most popular
                coffee types enjoyed around the world!
            </p>
        </section>
        <!-- Types of espresso coffees -->
        <section id="espresso">
            <h4>Espresso-Based Coffees</h4>
            <p>
                Espresso serves as the base for many popular coffee drinks. It is made by forcing hot water through
                finely-ground coffee under high pressure. The result is a concentrated coffee shot with a strong flavor.
                Here are a few drinks that are built around espresso:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Espresso:</strong> A small, concentrated shot of coffee served without milk or water.</li>
                <li><strong>Americano:</strong> Espresso diluted with hot water, giving it a similar strength to regular
                    drip coffee.</li>
                <li><strong>Cappuccino:</strong> Equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam, often topped with a
                    sprinkle of cocoa powder.</li>
                <li><strong>Latte:</strong> Espresso with steamed milk, topped with a small amount of milk foam, making
                    it creamier than a cappuccino.</li>
                <li><strong>Macchiato:</strong> Espresso with a small amount of milk or foam added on top, giving it a
                    bold flavor with a slight creaminess.</li>
                <li><strong>Mocha:</strong> A combination of espresso, steamed milk, and chocolate syrup, often topped
                    with whipped cream.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Coffee Variations -->
        <section id="variations">
            <h4>Different Coffee Variations</h4>
            <p>There are many other variations of coffee that combine different ingredients or flavors to suit a variety
                of tastes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Affogato:</strong> A scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with a shot of hot espresso, creating
                    a delightful contrast of temperatures and flavors.</li>
                <li><strong>Iced Coffee:</strong> Regular coffee served over ice, often sweetened or flavored with milk
                    or syrup.</li>
                <li><strong>Turkish Coffee:</strong> A traditional method where finely ground coffee is simmered with
                    water and sugar in a small pot, served unfiltered with a thick foam.</li>
                <li><strong>Flat White:</strong> Similar to a latte, but with a higher ratio of coffee to milk, giving
                    it a stronger coffee flavor and creamy texture.</li>
            </ul>

            <article class="historyPart">
                <h4>The legend of coffee origin begins in Ethiopia</h4>
                <p>
                    Ethiopia is widely considered to be the epicentre of where coffee came from. If you’ve ever googled
                    “coffee history”, you will have come across the famous story of how coffee was discovered in
                    Ethiopia by Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat herder, around 800 AD. He wandered over to his goats to see
                    them acting very strangely. They were energised and excited after eating some berries from a tree.
                    So, he tried the berries himself, and after he too felt excitable and alert, Kaldi took these
                    berries to a monk. The monks exclaimed that it was the work of the devil and threw the berries into
                    the fire. In doing so, a beautiful, heavenly aroma was released and the berries were quickly raked
                    from the fire and crushed into embers. Realising their mistake, the monks then placed the berries
                    into a jug and covered them with hot water for preservation. The monks went on to drink this lovely
                    new concoction, only to realise it helped them stay awake during nightly devotions and prayers. Of
                    course, this is probably just a wonderful legend and the history of coffee is more likely to lie
                    with the nomadic Oromo/Galla people of Ethiopia and northern Kenya.

                <p>
                    As it’s thought that coffee originated in Ethiopia, it’s also believed it made its way north across
                    the red sea into Yemen in the 15th Century. It then started to be grown in the Yemeni district of
                    Arabia, and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. It was immensely
                    popular for its qualities to help improve alertness and wakefulness, allowing people to devote more
                    time to spiritual matters and praying.

            <h3 id="beans-heading">Coffee Beans</h3>
            <p>
                Coffee beans come in many varieties, but the two most well-known types are Arabica and Robusta. These
                beans have distinct characteristics that influence the flavor, aroma, and overall experience of the
                coffee. Understanding the differences between these two types of coffee beans can help you appreciate
                the rich diversity of flavors that coffee has to offer.
            </p>

            <article>
                <h4>Arabica Coffee Beans</h4>
                <p><strong>Arabica beans</strong> are the most popular type of coffee bean in the world, accounting for
                    about 60–70% of global coffee production. They are grown at higher altitudes, typically in Latin
                    America, Africa, and Asia. Arabica beans are known for their smooth, mild flavor and aromatic
                    qualities. The taste tends to be sweeter and more complex compared to other types of coffee, with
                    notes of fruit, sugar, and floral undertones. Arabica coffee is often described as having a brighter
                    acidity, which makes it a favorite for those who enjoy a more refined and flavorful cup of coffee.
                </p>
                <p>In terms of caffeine content, Arabica beans have less caffeine than Robusta beans, which contributes
                    to a smoother, less bitter flavor profile. Arabica coffee is generally considered to have a higher
                    quality and is often more expensive due to the more labor-intensive growing process.</p>

                <h4>Robusta Coffee Beans</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Robusta beans</strong> are known for their strong, bold flavor and higher caffeine content.
                    These beans are primarily grown in Africa and Southeast Asia, and they thrive at lower altitudes
                    compared to Arabica beans. Robusta coffee is often described as having a more bitter and earthy
                    taste, with woody or nutty notes. The higher caffeine content in Robusta beans contributes to their
                    stronger, more intense flavor, which many people enjoy in espresso blends for its fuller body and
                    crema.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Arabica, Robusta beans are more resilient and easier to cultivate, making them less
                    expensive and more widely available. The taste of Robusta is more astringent, and the coffee tends
                    to have a more robust, sometimes even harsh flavor that some coffee drinkers prefer, especially
                    those who enjoy a stronger kick in their cup.
                </p>
            </article>

            <p>In summary, the choice between Arabica and Robusta largely comes down to personal preference. If you
                prefer a smoother, sweeter coffee with complex flavors, Arabica is likely your best choice. On the other
                hand, if you like your coffee strong, bold, and full-bodied, Robusta may be the perfect fit for you.</p>
